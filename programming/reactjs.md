# React

## useEffect

- useEffect runs only once, when the component is mounted if you pass it an
  empty array as a second argument. If you don't pass the second parameter, it
  runs every time the component renders, that is to say, every time it's state
  or props change.

## useHistory

~~~
const history = useHistory();
...
history.push("/some-path");


~~~
